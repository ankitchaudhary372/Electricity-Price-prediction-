# âš¡ Electricity Cost Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting **monthly electricity costs** using **Linear Regression** based on various site-specific features like **site area, structure type, water consumption, recycling rate, utilisation rate, air quality index, and resident count**.  
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that provides accurate cost predictions and deploy it through a **Streamlit web application**.
